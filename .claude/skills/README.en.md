A strong paper is rarely defined by the final PDF alone. What matters is the research storyline behind it: an unstable idea finds its position through literature, earns credibility through experiments, becomes a legible argument through writing, and is refined again through review and rebuttal. The hard part is not only drafting one introduction paragraph. The hard part is keeping the idea, evidence, experiments, narrative, and response aligned around the same research question.

CCFA Skills starts from that observation. It treats a CCF-A paper project as a research storyline that can be maintained, audited, and advanced over time, rather than as a one-shot text generation task. An idea should be shaped before it is defended. Experiments should serve explicit claims rather than merely fill tables. Writing should preserve evidence boundaries. A rebuttal should not be an improvised answer at the end of the process, but a traceable bridge to revision and resubmission.

The central insight is that paper quality comes from the quality of continuous decisions. The current family has 17 runtime roles and puts `ccf-humanization` first for manuscript and publication-facing experiment artifacts: fluent, natural, and rigorous academic prose; separate user-review warnings; minimal effective smoke tests; and no generic SHA-256 provenance ritual. Method completeness is checked internally, while the paper describes the actual method directly instead of exposing engineering-status language such as “confirmed” or “approved.”

## v0.8 Visual Demos

v0.8 preserves the existing 17-skill architecture and paper-project lifecycle. It strengthens two cross-cutting capabilities: `ccf-humanization` as the first preflight, and `ccf-visual-composer` for content-grounded scientific architecture prompts, confirmed generation, structure QA, and editable SVG/PDF reconstruction. In the three demos, only the titles are in Simplified Chinese; internal modules, labels, and sentences remain in English. Ordinary English follows natural title or sentence case, while acronyms and initialisms such as CCF, GPT, QA, SVG, PDF, AI, PNG, and SHA-256 remain uppercase.

The concrete Transformer examples show how `Visual Composer` replaces a generic black box with an inspectable encoder-decoder topology, while `CCF Humanization` removes defensive prose and duplicated smoke checks, checks method completeness internally, describes the actual method naturally, and keeps review warnings outside the paper.

## Workflow

The default paper-project loop is:

```text
humanization preflight
  -> project scaffold
  -> workflow orchestration
  -> idea optimization
  -> idea review
  -> literature monitoring / competitor tracking
  -> literature search
  -> experiment design
  -> visual composition
  -> writing exemplar extraction (optional)
  -> venue-aware writing
  -> scientific/writing review
  -> integrity audit
  -> submission package check
  -> rebuttal / revision ledger / resubmission
```

`ccfa.yaml` is the shared project-state file. It records `target_venue`, `stage`, `artifacts`, `claims`, `experiments`, `reviews`, `revision_ledger`, and `submission_checks`, so skills can hand off without overwriting each other's files.

## Artifact Contract

![Artifact contract](assets/ccfa-skills-artifacts.svg)

`ccfa.yaml` is a status spine, not the whole paper. Concrete outputs still live in idea briefs, literature notes, experiment plans, visual contracts, Python plotting scripts, manuscripts, review reports, integrity audits, submission checks, and revision ledgers. Review and audit skills diagnose; writing changes go back to `ccf-paper-writer`; visual layout and plotting changes go to `ccf-visual-composer`.

## Output Policy

- Writing, polishing, compression, and presentation tasks should follow the user's requested output format.
- If the user provides LaTeX, preserve LaTeX; if the user provides Markdown, preserve Markdown.
- From-scratch manuscript requests read the target venue guide and page budget first; if missing, use the NeurIPS fallback.
- Submission-style full drafts should target the venue's main-body length. Underfilled drafts are expanded by `ccf-paper-writer`; overfilled drafts are compressed by `ccf-paper-writer`; final page compliance is checked by `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Non-review skills should produce concrete, information-dense artifacts.
- Review, audit, and submission-gate skills may remain more structured because their value is traceable diagnosis.
- No skill may invent results, citations, official rules, or reviewer conclusions.

## Venue Guides

Venue-specific LaTeX/template information is reference material:

```text
ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md
ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/<venue>.md
```

Use `ccf-paper-writer` for venue-aware manuscript writing. Use `ccf-submission-checker` for page limits, anonymity, PDF metadata, camera-ready checks, and artifact readiness.
